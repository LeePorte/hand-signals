## Information automatically collected

In Short: Some anonymised information — such as IP address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you use the service.

Nod automatically collects certain information when you visit, use or navigate the service. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of the service, and for any internal analytics and reporting purposes.

## Will you information be shared with anyone?

In Short: No. I have no desire to share any anonymised data with anyone. The data provided is purely for the functionality of the extension itself and will never be shared with any external parties.
